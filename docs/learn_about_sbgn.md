## Learn About SBGN

#### [SBGN Publications](publications.md)
For a quick introduction about SBGN, please go to our [Publications](publications.md) page where you can find the initial paper describing the effort, as well as the current specifications.

#### Tutorials and presentations

#### [Examples](examples.md)
This page provides examples of all three SBGN languages

#### Using SBGN
* [Software](software.md) You can find a list of software from our software page
* [Templates](templates.md) This link provides SBGN glyphs templates (reference cards) in various format so that you can incorporate them into your diagram.

### Educational Resources

Below are links to courses partially or exclusively devoted to teaching SBGN to students. It is aimed to help an educator to build a course and select tools to be used during the course.

# SBGN courses/lectures for graduate and undergrad students and tools used

-   Fall 2012 [Introduction to Systems Biology](http://www.ccam.uchc.edu/mblinov/MEDS-6455-2012-Fall.html) graduate course at [Center for Cell Analysis and Modeling](http://www.ccam.uchc.edu/) ([UCHC](http://www.uchc.edu/)) has a lecture and a set of assignments in SBGN. Tools and techniques taught:
    -   Reading SBGN using Panther and Reactome databases
    -   Drawing SBGN using CellDesigner & SBGN-ED.
    -   Drawing MIM (roughly similar to SBGN-ED) using Pathvisio-MIM.

-   April 2013 Tutorial on [Mathematical Modeling for the Cell Biology Researcher and Educator](http://www.nimbios.org/wordpress-training/cellbiology/schedule/) had couple of lectures mentioning SBGN.

# SBGN "student-friendly" tools used in course

This is not a comprehensive list of SBGN-supporting tools! Only tools friendly enough that have been used in student education are listed here.

-   [PANTHER](http://www.pantherdb.org/pathway/) - has a large collection of pathways beautifully drawn in SBGN-PD. Was used in UCHC ISB course.
-   [CellDesigner](http://www.celldesigner.org/) - used by many biologists (both modelers and non-modelers) to draw SBGN-PD diagrams that can be either converted to a computable model or used for presentations. Was used in UCHC ISB course.
-   [SBGN-ED (Vanted)](http://www.sbgn-ed.org/) - a tool that can be used to draw SBGN-PD, ER and AF. Was used in UCHC ISB course.

#### How to Contribute

If you gave a course that included SBGN, or developed an SBGN software that was used in educational activities, please send your slides or links to tools and course pages to Michael Blinov at blinov @ uchc . edu. You can also request a login and password to edit this page from Mike Hucka at ...
